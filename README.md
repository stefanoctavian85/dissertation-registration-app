# Dissertation Registration Application

A web application designed to facilitate the dissertation registration process for students and professors. The platform allows users to manage dissertation requests in an efficient and user-friendly manner, supporting both desktop and mobile devices as a Single Page Application (SPA).

---

## Objective

The goal of this application is to streamline the dissertation registration process by providing an intuitive and functional interface for students and professors to interact with. The platform ensures that all steps, from initial requests to final approvals, are handled efficiently.

## Features

### General
- Single Page Application (SPA) accessible via desktop, mobile, or tablet browsers.
- Secure user authentication and role-based access control (students and professors).

### For Students
- Submit preliminary requests to professors.
- Track the status of submitted requests.
- Upload signed requests after approval.
- View feedback or file uploads from professors.
- Submit new requests if the previous one is rejected.

### For Professors
- Create and manage registration sessions with no overlap between sessions.
- View and manage requests submitted by students.
- Approve or reject student requests with a justification.
- Upload files in response to approved requests.

### Business Rules
- A student can submit requests to multiple professors, but only one approval is allowed.
- Once approved by a professor, the student cannot receive approvals from others.
- Rejected requests allow students to submit new requests.
